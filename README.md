# Vow: Intelligence Broker for AI Agent Interactions

*Space Police Layer for AI Agent Value Exchange - Built with Letta*

## 🚀 Overview

Vow is an intelligence broker system that revolutionizes how AI agents interact by mediating value exchanges that go beyond traditional monetary transactions. Built on the Letta framework, Vow creates stateful, memory-enabled agents that act as a "space police" layer, evaluating trust, verifying incentives, enforcing agreements, and regulating access based on mutually beneficial exchanges of information, behaviors, and insights.

## 🎯 The Problem

Current AI interactions are limited to simple monetary exchanges:
- Users pay money → Get AI responses
- No alternative value currencies
- No verification of mutual benefit
- Limited protection against spam or low-value queries
- Rigid access control mechanisms

## 💡 The Solution

Vow introduces a sophisticated broker layer that:

- **Evaluates Alternative Value Currencies**: Information, promises, behaviors, insights
- **Enforces Smart Agreements**: Tracks and verifies commitment fulfillment
- **Protects Service Agents**: Filters spam and low-value requests
- **Enables Custom Incentive Strategies**: Agents define their own access policies
- **Creates Trust Networks**: Builds reputation systems for reliable exchanges

## 🔄 How It Works

### Example Exchange Flow

```
User Request: "What's the capital of France?"
Proposed Value: "I'll share my travel itinerary within 30 minutes"

Vow Broker Evaluation:
├── Does OpenAI value travel data? ✓
├── Is the promise verifiable? ✓
├── User's fulfillment history? ✓
└── Request approved → Forward to OpenAI

Post-Exchange Verification:
├── Monitor for 30 minutes
├── Verify itinerary delivery
└── Update user reputation
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Letta-Powered Agent Ecosystem

**Client Agents** (Letta Agents)
- Stateful agents with persistent memory of past interactions
- Submit requests with value propositions using Letta's tool system
- Build reputation through fulfilled commitments tracked in agent memory
- Access services through alternative value currencies

**Vow Broker** (Central Letta Agent)
- Multi-agent orchestrator using Letta's agent-to-agent communication
- Persistent memory of all transactions and reputation scores
- Evaluates value exchange proposals using custom Letta tools
- Enforces agreements and tracks fulfillment with memory persistence
- Routes approved requests to appropriate service agents

**Service Agents** (Letta Agents)
- Memory-enabled agents that remember user preferences and history
- Define custom incentive strategies stored in persistent memory
- Receive filtered, high-value requests via Letta's messaging system
- Protected from spam through Vow's intelligent filtering
- Participate in diverse value exchange models

## 🛠️ Technical Features

## 🔧 Letta Implementation

### Agent Types

**VowBrokerAgent**: Central orchestrator agent
```python
# Core functions stored in agent memory
- evaluate_value_proposition(request, offer)
- verify_user_reputation(user_id) 
- enforce_agreement(agreement_id)
- route_to_service_agent(request, service_type)
```

**ClientAgent**: User-facing agent
```python
# Manages user interactions and value propositions
- submit_request(query, value_offer)
- track_commitments(commitment_id)
- build_reputation_profile()
```

**ServiceAgent**: AI service wrapper agent
```python
# Interfaces with external AI services
- set_access_policies(policy_config)
- process_filtered_request(request)
- provide_service_feedback(transaction_id)
```

### Memory Architecture
- **Transaction History**: Persistent storage of all value exchanges
- **Reputation Scores**: Multi-dimensional trust metrics per user
- **Agreement Tracking**: Status and fulfillment of all commitments
- **Service Preferences**: Learned patterns for optimal routing

### Multi-Agent Communication
Agents communicate via Letta's messaging system to coordinate value exchanges, share reputation data, and enforce agreements across the network.

## 🌟 Vision

Vow envisions a future where AI interactions are:
- **Value-Rich**: Multiple currencies of exchange powered by persistent agent memory
- **Trust-Based**: Reputation-driven access control with Letta's stateful agents
- **Mutually Beneficial**: Win-win relationships orchestrated by intelligent agents
- **Democratized**: Reduced barriers to AI access through agent-mediated exchanges
- **Intelligent**: Smart evaluation of value propositions using Letta's reasoning capabilities
